Introduction

Waiting in Hotel lobbies for hours in order to book your room and waiting until it is ready can be very time-consuming and tiring as well. Nowadays, the most innovative way is to book your room using a website or an application. This web application's main idea is a website for an imaginary hotel named “YYA HOTELS”, This website allows people to view the hotel and its’ locations, rooms, services, ability to contact the hotel, , and it also gives visitors the ability to book their rooms from the website,  so that they don't have to wait for a long time until their room is ready. This website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and for the backend: PHP, mySQL. YYA Hotels’ website is designed to work on any device, without any bugs or malfunctions. 

First Web Page: Home Page
In order to attract customers to book their stay with YYA hotels, the home page, which is the first page that the user sees upon opening the website, had to be eye-catching. 
 
Screenshot (1): The Home Page
Screenshot (1) shows the first section of the page which includes a navigation bar at the top of the webpage(which is present at each webpage), so users could navigate between multiple webpages and check our destinations, or rooms for example. Then, a slider that shows multiple images of YYA Hotels, then a search button that navigates to our locations upon clicking.
 
Screenshot (2): Who We Are
Then after scrolling, we move to the next section of the home page, which is the “Who We Are” section, or in other words “About US” section. This section gives visitors a small background about YYA hotels, when was it founded, our goal, and locations.
 
Screenshot (3): Our Locations
The 3rd section in our home page is the “Our Locations” section, in this section, we give users the ability to first see our locations, then the user could click on any of the displayed locations, and the website will navigate to the location’s web page, which will be mentioned in the upcoming documentation.

Screenshot (5): Services
Screenshots 4 & 5 show the 4th section in our home page, which is the “Services” section. In this section, Customers can see services provided at YYA hotels, such as top tier dining service, or festivals done at our hotels.

Now, moving on to the last section on the website’s home page before the footer, the “Contact Us” section. In this section if a customer is interested in knowing more details regarding our services, rooms reservation, or has any inquiry in general, they could leave us their name, email, the subject of their inquiry, and their message. After submitting, the interested customers’ details are automatically sent to our database using PHP and mySQL, so that our team can contact them with all the details.
 
Screenshot (8): The Footer
Lastly, the footer, which is the last section in all webpages in our website. The footer includes our hotel logo, which navigates to the home page, a contact us button which navigates to the contact us section in the home page as well, and navigation links to other webpages in our website.
Destinations
New Alamein
Website users can navigate to the “New Alamein” webpage either by using the navigation bar present at each webpage in our website, or by clicking on the New Alamein poster in the “Our locations” section in the website’s home page.
 
Screenshot (9): New Alamein web page
After navigating to the New Alamein web page, first, the user sees the title of the web page with a background image showing the city of the web page navigated to. Then after scrolling down a bit, a small introduction about the city is provided, so that visitors can have a background about the city they are travelling to.

The next section is the “Our Hotel(s)” section, which shows visitors what YYA hotel(s) is/are present in the chosen city, and some description regarding the hotel itself, and if visitors are interested in booking, they can click on the “Book Now” button, which navigates to New Alamein’s rooms webpage, in which he can book his reservation. Then, the last section in this web page is the footer as well.

Using the same navigation method as New Alamein, users can also navigate to Dubai web page.

Following the same structure as in the “New Alamein” Web Page, first, we start by showing the user the title of the web page, with a background of Dubai. Then, a small description about Dubai city is given to the user.

Our last destination is Hurghada city in Egypt. Hurghada’s webpage follows the same structure used in Dubai’s webpage and New Alamein’s webpage, which is a background image of Hurghada with the title of the web page, and a small introduction about Hurghada city.
